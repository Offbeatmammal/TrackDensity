# Track Density
Monitor track density at an "open pitlane" motorsport event.

If you're running an open pitlane at a motorsport event, where cars can join/exit ad hoc rather than in run groups, but you have to monitor/manage a maximum track density for safety, you often end up juggling bits of paper, stones, or other counters.

This simple HTML/Javascript page gives you an easy way to track cars out, cars in, view current track density, and count the total number of cars that have gone out (handy if it's a passenger ride session or similar).

Shortcut keys:
* <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>o</kbd>: record car out (onto circuit)
* <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>: record car in (into pit lane)

To Do
=====
* It's not very pretty! Need to play with the UX both for desktop and mobile.
*  Would be fun to make it multi-user, so one person can see Pit Exit, and another Pit Entry and work together to manage density.
